# Data Science Assignment: Trading Performance vs. Market Sentiment

## Project by: Akanksha

### Project Workflow
This repository contains the complete analysis for the data science hiring task. The project is organized to be run in the following order:

1.  **`1_Data_Preparation.ipynb`**: This notebook loads, cleans, and merges the raw data files.
2.  **`2_Analysis_and_Visualization.ipynb`**: This notebook performs the main analysis and generates the final plots and summary tables.
3.  **`3_Final_Report.pdf`**: This report summarizes the key findings and actionable insights from the analysis.

### **IMPORTANT: Setup Instructions to Run the Code**

The primary dataset (`historical_data`) is too large (48 MB) to be hosted on GitHub and has been intentionally excluded from this repository.

To run the analysis notebooks, please follow these two steps:

1.  **Download the Trader Data:**
    *   The official `historical_data` file can be downloaded directly from the link provided in the assignment:
    *   [**Click here to download historical_data**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IAfLZwu6rJzyWKgBToqwSmmVYU6VbjVs/view?usp=sharing)

2.  **Place the File in the `csv_files` Folder:**
    *   After downloading, place the `historical_data` file inside the `csv_files` folder within this project.

Once the file is in the correct location, the notebooks can be run sequentially without any errors. All other required files, including `fear_greed_index.csv`, are already included in the repository.
